Capture-recapture refers to a series of methods that are used to estimate the size of a population from at least two incomplete, matched lists.  With human populations, heterogeneity in the capture probability is a serious concern as it can impact the estimation process. This proposal outlines a framework for incorporating heterogeneity through known covariates into the estimation process and develops an extensible model under this framework which we call the Bayesian Logistic Regression model for Capture-Recapture (BLRCR). The posterior distribution is estimated using the complete likelihood through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm.  Through a careful examination of the problem and a series of demonstrations, three important areas of future research become apparent for the dissertation project. First, we should consider the impact of the specification of the covariate distribution and explore additional non-parametric solutions.  Second, we should consider the unobserved heterogeneity and specifically how to implement a procedure that accounts for this violation in the conditional independence assumption.  Third, we should consider the impact of variable selection.
