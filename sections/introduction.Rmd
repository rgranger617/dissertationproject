\section{Introduction}

Capture-Recapture (CR) refers to a series of methods that are used to estimate the size of a population from at least two incomplete, matched lists.  While one could simply count the number of unique names between the lists, this would provide only a lower bound estimate of the population size.  Presumably, there are individuals who were not captured in any of the lists.  CR methods use assumptions along with patterns in the data to create estimates for how many individuals were missed and therefore inherently the size of the total population.

CR methods have been used in a wide array of subject areas including ecology \citep{henderson_ecological_2016}, epidemiology \citep{goldberg_estimation_1978,baker_simple_1990}, U.S. Census adjustments \citep{darroch_three-sample_1993}, and estimating the number of pages on the internet \citep{lawrence_searching_1998,khabsa_number_2014}. The method has also been applied to casualty data from various conflicts including Colombia \citep{guberek_count_2010,manriquevallier_bayesian_2016}, Guatemala \citep{ball_making_2000,ball_statistics_2018}, Kosovo \citep{ball_killings_2002,manriquevallier_bayesian_2016}, Peru \citep{ball_estimate_2003}, and many others.  Most early applications of capture-recapture, also called mark and recapture, were in the context of animal populations where a number of animals were initially captured, marked or tagged, and then released.  This was followed up with another capturing occasion where animals were captured and checked for a marking. A CR dataset is then a listing of each unique animal captured after all sampling occasions have taken place.  Each unique animal's capture history is included which identifies which occasion(s) the animal was captured. In the context of human populations, CR methods are sometimes referred to as multiple systems estimation (MSE). Lists of subjects may be collected by various institutions including hospitals, government agencies, or other non-governmental organizations but are left incomplete due to lack of resources, mistakes/omissions, or just the inability to obtain such information. These lists can then be combined and constructed to form a dataset for CR.  For example, \cite{zwane_population_2005} attempts to determine the number of Dutch children born with a neural tube defect (NTD) in the year 2000 by analyzing three national databases tracking these occurrences. For multiple reasons including risk assessment of the pregnancy and omissions, not all children with NTDs are reported to each database. Another example, the counting of casualties by a reporting agency may only be partially collected because of non-cooperation from victims due to lack of trust, danger posed to data collectors, and/or destroyed
infrastructure \citep{manrique-vallier_capture-recapture_2020}.  

CR methods often come with many assumptions including a closed population, independence between lists, and homogeneity in the capture probability between individuals.  In particular, the aim of this proposal is to extend methods that target the homogeneity assumption, the requirement that all individuals have the same probability of capture regardless of any personal attributes.  While this may be a palatable assumption for some animal populations, this is unlikely with human populations. Different characteristics like age or social status may influence the probability of their capture. If data is present that can fully explain the heterogeneity, one could incorporate this into the modeling process by either including it as a covariate in a model like logistic regression \citep{alho_logistic_1990,baker_simple_1990} or by stratifying before applying their CR method of choice \citep{sekar_method_1949,manrique-vallier_estimating_2019}.  On the other hand, heterogeneity may exist but covariate information may not exist or is not fully adequate. 

The objective of this dissertation project is to develop a new method for the CR problem that can properly and adequately account for both types of individual heterogeneity. Estimating the size of the population tends to be highly susceptible to the structure of the modeling when dealing with CR methods.  Therefore, implementing covariates in an improper way or not adequately accounting for the unobservable heterogeneity can bias the inference. As a result, we propose developing a method that is 1) a fully Bayesian approach, 2) uses the full likelihood as suggested by \cite{pollock_use_2002}, and 3) can robustly account for both the observed and unobserved individual heterogeneity.  

We begin by developing a framework for CR that incorporates covariates to account for the known heterogeneity, which is similar to the complete likelihood specification in \citep{king_capturerecapture_2016}, except we 1) strictly define the unobserved heterogeneity components as the unobserved covariates belonging to unobserved individuals and 2) we recognize these unobserved covariates in the same vein as missing parameters. The intricacy of treating the unobserved covariates like missing parameters results in a slight different likelihood but ultimately no affect on the posterior. Next, we specify a model under this framework that uses conditionally independent logistic regressions which we term the Bayesian Logistic Regression Capture-Recapture (BLRCR) model. While the BLRCR model incorporates individual covariates into addressing the observable heterogeneity, it has a few shortcomings which is the focus of the three most important proposed extensions for this project. First, since covariates are missing at least for the unobserved individuals, the use of a full likelihood approach requires the specification of a distribution for the covariates. As we will see in \ref{Sec:simulations}, misspecifying the distribution can lead to incorrect inference. Like previous approaches, we apply a normal distribution; however, we propose a new method of using non-parametric approaches to the covariates such as an infinite mixture of normal distributions. The second proposed area of extension involves the handling of unobservable heterogeneity. We view the idea of unobservable heterogeneity from an omitted covariates perspective. We propose accounting for this unobserved heterogeneity by assuming individuals belong to latent classes which impact the probability of capture through an additional intercept. The third extension we propose is resolving how to determine which covariates to include and how each covariate should be included in the regression. There are multiple ways to account for this issue, but we propose exploring it through the lens of variable selection.

This document proceeds as follows: Section \ref{Sec:litreview} provides a review of the capture-recapture literature.  Section \ref{sec:CRwithCovariates} details the proposed work for the dissertation by developing a framework for capture-recapture problem with covariates and proposing three areas for extension. Section \ref{Sec:simulations} provides some preliminary work addressing the model through a variety of simulations.  Section \ref{Sec:timeline} lists future steps to be taken to complete the dissertation along with an estimated timeline.
